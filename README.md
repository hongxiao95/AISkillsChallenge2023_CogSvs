Resources for Microsoft Learn AI Skills Challenge 2023

This repository is created for Microsoft Learn AI Skills Challenge 2023 - Cognitive Service Challenge

We have a C# demo, a Python demo for object detection with camera captured images, and a Python demo for object detection with Tello drone captured images.

The C# demo is built as a Universal Windows Platform app.

Two Python demos are created based on OpenCV, azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision, and djitellopy.
